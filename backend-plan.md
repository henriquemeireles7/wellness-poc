Below is a **high-level, step-by-step plan** for implementing the **backend** portion of your product as described in the PRD, Database Schema, and API specifications. This plan focuses on **one change per step**, each tied to a specific file or configuration, and does **not include actual code**. Instead, it provides guidance on **what** to change, **why** it’s being changed, **how** to approach it, plus any useful **tips** and **packages** you may need.

## Backend Implementation Plan

### Introduction
The purpose of this plan is to translate the backend requirements from your PRD (including the Database Schema and API Contract) into actionable steps. Each step corresponds to a single file or configuration change in your codebase. By following this sequence, you’ll establish a solid foundation for authentication, database modeling, business logic (bookings, payments, etc.), and integrations (Google Calendar, Stripe).

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create a `.env` File for Environment Variables
- **Why**: You’ll need a secure place to store sensitive information such as database connection strings, API keys (e.g., Google Calendar, Stripe), and Supabase project credentials.
- **How**:  
  1. In the root of your project, create a file named `.env`.  
  2. Add variables like `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, etc.  
  3. Make sure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file so it’s never committed.  
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - Use descriptive names for your variables.  
  - Keep different `.env` files or variable values for local, staging, and production environments.  
- **Packages**: None needed at this step.

---

### Step 2: Install Core Dependencies in `package.json`
- **Why**: Your backend needs specific libraries to handle the database, authentication, and third-party integrations (Stripe, Google).
- **How**:  
  1. In your `package.json`, add or confirm dependencies for:
     - **Prisma** (e.g., `"prisma"`, `"@prisma/client"`)
     - **Supabase** JavaScript client (e.g., `"@supabase/supabase-js"`)
     - (Optional) **Stripe** Node package if you’re handling webhooks server-side (`"stripe"`)
     - (Optional) **node-fetch** or other libraries for making HTTP requests, if needed.
  2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install them.
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - If you’re using serverless Next.js API routes, these packages should be installed in the same project.  
  - Keep versions pinned or use a caret range to ensure compatibility.
- **Packages**:  
  - `npm install prisma @prisma/client @supabase/supabase-js stripe` (adjust to your needs).

---

### Step 3: Initialize Prisma in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Why**: Prisma requires a schema file (`schema.prisma`) to define your database models (Users, Businesses, Bookings, etc.).
- **How**:  
  1. If you haven’t already, run `npx prisma init` (or `yarn prisma init`). This creates a `/prisma` folder with `schema.prisma` and updates your `.env` with a placeholder `DATABASE_URL`.
  2. Open the newly created `schema.prisma` file for editing.
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - Make sure your `.env` file has a valid `DATABASE_URL` (e.g., pointing to Postgres).  
  - If you’re using Supabase’s built-in Postgres, get the connection string from your Supabase dashboard.
- **Packages**:  
  - Already installed in the previous step (`prisma`, `@prisma/client`).

---

### Step 4: Add the `Users` Model in `schema.prisma`
- **Why**: A `Users` table is required for both B2B (wellness providers) and B2C (consumers).
- **How**:  
  1. In `schema.prisma`, define a model named `User` (or `Users`) with fields like `id`, `email`, `name`, `role` (enum or string), and timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`).  
  2. Use the `@id` and `@default(uuid())` annotations for the primary key.
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - Consider an enum for `role`, e.g., `enum Role { B2B B2C }`, or store it as a string field.  
  - Make `email` unique.
- **Packages**: None new.

---

### Step 5: Add the `Businesses` Model in `schema.prisma`
- **Why**: Businesses store data for the wellness providers (B2B users).
- **How**:  
  1. Create a model named `Business` (or `Businesses`) with fields like:  
     - `id` (UUID, primary key)  
     - `ownerId` (references `User.id`)  
     - `name`, `description`, `category`, `location`, etc.  
  2. Link it to `User` with a foreign key relation: `ownerId  User  @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id])`.
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - Decide on `location` storage (string, JSON, etc.).  
  - If you have categories as an enum, define it in the schema.
- **Packages**: None new.

---

### Step 6: Add the `Availability` Model in `schema.prisma`
- **Why**: Each Business has different availability times.
- **How**:  
  1. Create a model named `Availability` with fields like `id`, `businessId`, `dayOfWeek`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `duration`.  
  2. Link `businessId` to `Business.id`.  
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - Keep dayOfWeek as an integer (0=Sunday, etc.) or use an enum.  
  - `startTime` and `endTime` can be `DateTime` or `String`, but typically you’d use `DateTime`.
- **Packages**: None new.

---

### Step 7: Add the `Bookings` Model in `schema.prisma`
- **Why**: Bookings link B2C users to B2B businesses for specific times.
- **How**:  
  1. Create a model named `Booking` with `id`, `userId`, `businessId`, `startDatetime`, `endDatetime`, and a `status` field.  
  2. Link `userId` to `User.id` and `businessId` to `Business.id`.
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - `status` can be an enum: `{ PENDING, CONFIRMED, COMPLETED, CANCELED }`.
  - Consider indexing `startDatetime` for faster queries.
- **Packages**: None new.

---

### Step 8: Add the `Payments` Model in `schema.prisma`
- **Why**: Payments track transaction details from Stripe or other providers.
- **How**:  
  1. Create a model named `Payment` with fields such as `id`, `bookingId`, `stripePaymentIntentId`, `amount`, `currency`, `status`, etc.  
  2. Link `bookingId` to `Booking.id`.
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - Store amounts in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents).
  - Keep references to Stripe objects for quick lookup.
- **Packages**: None new.

---

### Step 9: Add the `CalendarTokens` Model in `schema.prisma`
- **Why**: You need to store OAuth tokens for Google Calendar integration.
- **How**:  
  1. Create a model named `CalendarToken` with `id`, `userId`, `googleAccessToken`, `googleRefreshToken`, `tokenExpiry`, etc.  
  2. Link `userId` to `User.id`.
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - Store sensitive tokens securely (encrypted at rest if possible).  
  - Refresh tokens must be kept carefully to avoid accidental disclosure.
- **Packages**: None new.

---

### Step 10: Run Prisma Migrations
- **Why**: To apply your new models and schema to the database.
- **How**:  
  1. In your terminal, run `npx prisma migrate dev --name init` (or `yarn prisma migrate dev --name init`).  
  2. Verify that tables are created in your Postgres (Supabase) database.
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - Check your `prisma/migrations` folder to ensure each migration is stored.  
  - Use staging and local environments to test migrations before production.
- **Packages**: None new.

---

### Step 11: Create a `SupabaseClient` Configuration File (e.g., `supabase.js`)
- **Why**: You need a single place to configure and export the Supabase client for server-side use.
- **How**:  
  1. Create a file, e.g., `src/lib/supabase.js`.  
  2. Initialize the client with your `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (from `.env`).  
  3. Export the client instance so it can be imported by routes or services.
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - This is often done on the frontend as well, but for server-side logic (like webhooks), you might use the Service Key.  
  - Keep your Service Key off the client side for security.
- **Packages**: None new (assuming `@supabase/supabase-js` is already installed).

---

### Step 12: Create an API Route/File for User Operations (e.g., `/api/users.js` or `/routes/users.js`)
- **Why**: According to the specification, you need to handle user sign-up, login, or any user profile fetching. Even if Supabase handles most auth flows, you might have custom endpoints.
- **How**:  
  1. Make a new file dedicated to user operations.  
  2. Outline endpoints (e.g., `POST /users`, `GET /users/:id`) referencing the database via Prisma or Supabase.  
  3. Include authentication checks if required.
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - If you’re relying heavily on Supabase Auth, you might only need minimal user endpoints.  
  - Return consistent JSON responses (e.g., `id`, `email`, `role`) and handle errors gracefully.
- **Packages**: None new.

---

### Step 13: Create an API Route/File for Business Operations (e.g., `/api/businesses.js` or `/routes/businesses.js`)
- **Why**: Businesses need CRUD operations for profile management, location, category, and so on.
- **How**:  
  1. Create endpoints like `GET /businesses` (list), `POST /businesses` (create), `GET /businesses/:id` (detail), etc.  
  2. Use Prisma’s `business` model to fetch and persist data.  
  3. Restrict creation/editing to B2B users only (check user role).
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - Filter by category or location if you need search functionality.  
  - Add role-based checks to ensure only the business owner can update their own data.
- **Packages**: None new.

---

### Step 14: Create an API Route/File for Availability (e.g., `/api/availability.js`)
- **Why**: The specification requires each business to define available time slots.
- **How**:  
  1. Expose endpoints like `POST /businesses/:id/availability` or handle them in a dedicated route.  
  2. Write logic to parse days of the week, times, and durations, then store them via the `Availability` model.
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - Validate time ranges (e.g., start < end).  
  - Consider time zones if the app is used globally.
- **Packages**: None new.

---

### Step 15: Create an API Route/File for Bookings (e.g., `/api/bookings.js`)
- **Why**: You need to let B2C users book appointments with B2B businesses, as per the core app functionality.
- **How**:  
  1. Endpoints like `POST /bookings` to create a booking, `GET /bookings/:id` to fetch, `PUT /bookings/:id` to update.  
  2. On successful booking, trigger logic to send a calendar invite (Google Calendar API) or schedule that in a background job.
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - Ensure the chosen time slot is still available.  
  - Mark the booking status as `PENDING` or `CONFIRMED` after payment.
- **Packages**: None new (Google Calendar steps come later).

---

### Step 16: Create an API Route/File for Payments (e.g., `/api/payments.js`)
- **Why**: The spec requires Stripe integration to handle payment creation and status updates.
- **How**:  
  1. Add an endpoint like `POST /payments` to initiate or confirm a payment.  
  2. Use the `stripe` package to create a payment intent, store the `stripePaymentIntentId` in your `Payment` table, and handle webhooks if needed.
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - Secure your webhook endpoint (e.g., `/api/webhooks/stripe`) with Stripe’s signing secret.  
  - Store amounts in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents).
- **Packages**: Stripe is already installed (`"stripe"`).

---

### Step 17: Integrate Google Calendar (e.g., `/api/integrations/google-calendar.js`)
- **Why**: Bookings should sync with Google Calendar for both the business and the user.
- **How**:  
  1. In this route, handle OAuth flows to retrieve and store `googleAccessToken`/`googleRefreshToken` in the `CalendarToken` model.  
  2. After a booking is confirmed, call the Google Calendar API to create an event.  
  3. Refresh tokens as needed.
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - Use the official Node.js Google APIs client (`npm install googleapis`) if you prefer.  
  - Handle token expiration gracefully by refreshing before making new calendar events.
- **Packages**:  
  - `npm install googleapis` (optional, if not already in your project).

---

### Step 18: Add Centralized Error Handling and Logging
- **Why**: A robust backend needs consistent error handling and logs for debugging.
- **How**:  
  1. In a main server file (e.g., `/api/_middleware.js`, `app.js`, or `server.js`), create an error-handling middleware.  
  2. Log errors using `console.error` or a logging library like `winston` or `pino`.
- **Tips/Points of Attention**:  
  - Return uniform error responses (`{ "error": "message" }`) with relevant HTTP status codes.  
  - Redact sensitive info (tokens, credentials) from logs.
- **Packages**:  
  - Optional: `npm install winston` (or another logger) if desired.

---

## Conclusion
By following these 18 steps—**one file/configuration change at a time**—you’ll build out the backend infrastructure specified in your PRD. Each step aligns with a key element from **database modeling** to **API routes** and **third-party integrations** (Stripe, Google Calendar). 

**Recommendation**:  
- **Test after each step** to confirm your setup works as expected (e.g., verifying database tables are created, endpoints return the correct JSON, payments succeed, calendar events appear).  
- **Iterate** as needed (especially for time-zone logic, booking validations, etc.) to refine your backend before moving on to production or broader features.

This plan ensures you address the core functionality (user roles, availability, bookings, payments, and calendar integration) while keeping the process organized and straightforward. Good luck with your implementation!
